    "    3. Best Practices (2025)\n",
    "    Pin Versions: Use == (e.g., pandas==2.2.0) to lock exact versions and prevent code from breaking due to unexpected updates.\n",
    "    Isolate Environments: Always activate your virtual environment before running pip freeze to avoid including global system packages.\n",
    "    Update Regularly: Re-run the freeze command whenever you install or update a new library to keep the file accurate.\n",
    "    Use Comments: You can add comments using # to explain why a specific version or package is needed.\n",
    "    Separate Environments: For large projects, consider using a separate requirements-dev.txt for development-only tools like testing frameworks or linters.\n",
    "    Modern Alternatives: For more complex dependency management in 2025, tools like uv or Poetry are recommended as they manage \"lock files\" more securely than standard text files.\"\"\"\n",

My journey has been full of learning, growth, and self-discovery, and I’m thrilled to share it.\\n\\nFrom day one, I was amazed by the infrastructure and a curriculum tailored to match real-world demands. Here, learning isn’t confined to textbooks; it’s all about hands-on experience, real-time projects, and practical application. \\n\\nData Science, for me, has become more than just a subject—it’s a beacon that guides my aspirations. And Malla Reddy University has been the foundation where I’ve built not just my skills, but also my confidence, values, and resilience. \\n\\n One of the biggest milestones in my journey came in my 5th semester, when I was placed at NTT Data—a dream company for many aspiring tech professionals. It felt surreal to secure such an opportunity early on. \\n\\nI owe much of my growth to our incredible faculty, who have always gone the extra mile. Whether it was academic guidance, project mentoring, or simply motivating us they’ve been our pillars of support. Their encouragement and patience have made all the difference. \\n\\nOur placement training programs through ByteXL, Neopat, and Eduskills have also been game-changers—equipping us with the technical know-how and soft skills needed to stand out in a competitive world. \\n\\nCertifications in Coursera,  Salesforce Administration and MuleSoft, thanks to the NTT Data Center of Excellence have further broadened my skillset and boosted my industry readiness. All of this is made possible by the visionary leadership that defines our university. Our Chief Patron, Shri Ch. Malla Reddy garu, has created a vibrant learning space. Our Vice Chancellor, Dr. VSK Reddy, ensures our academic pursuits are strong, and our Dean, Dr. G. S. Naveen Kumar, is a constant source of inspiration, keeping us aligned with the latest industry trends. Choosing Malla Reddy University has truly been a turning point in my life. I’m immensely proud to be part of this institution that shapes not just students—but future leaders.')]\n"

In\\nthis chapter, we discuss probability theory in more detail. We do not have to space to go into\\ngreat detail — for that, you are better off consulting some of the excellent textbooks available\\non this topic, such as (Jaynes 2003; Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis 2008; Wasserman 2004). But we will\\nbrieﬂy review many of the key ideas you will need in later chapters.\\nBefore we start with the more technical material, let us pause and ask: what is probability?\\nWe are all familiar with the phrase “the probability that a coin will land heads is 0.5”. But what\\ndoes this mean? There are actually at least two different interpretations of probability. One is\\ncalled the frequentist interpretation. In this view, probabilities represent long run frequencies\\nof events. For example, the above statement means that, if we ﬂip the coin many times, we\\nexpect it to land heads about half the time.1\\nThe other interpretation is called the Bayesian interpretation of probability. In this view,\\nprobability is used to quantify our uncertainty about something; hence it is fundamentally\\nrelated to information rather than repeated trials (Jaynes 2003). In the Bayesian view, the above\\nstatement means we believe the coin is equally likely to land heads or tails on the next toss.\\nOne big advantage of the Bayesian interpretation is that it can be used to model our uncer-\\ntainty about events that do not have long term frequencies. For example, we might want to\\ncompute the probability that the polar ice cap will melt by 2020 CE. This event will happen zero\\nor one times, but cannot happen repeatedly. Nevertheless, we ought to be able to quantify our\\nuncertainty about this event; based on how probable we think this event is, we will (hopefully!)\\ntake appropriate actions (see Section 5.7 for a discussion of optimal decision making under\\nuncertainty). To give some more machine learning oriented examples, we might have received\\na speciﬁc email message, and want to compute the probability it is spam. Or we might have\\nobserved a “blip” on our radar screen, and want to compute the probability distribution over\\nthe location of the corresponding target (be it a bird, plane, or missile). In all these cases, the\\nidea of repeated trials does not make sense, but the Bayesian interpretation is valid and indeed\\n1. Actually, the Stanford statistician (and former professional magician) Persi Diaconis has shown that a coin is about\\n51% likely to land facing the same way up as it started, due to the physics of the problem (Diaconis et al. 2007).',\n",
